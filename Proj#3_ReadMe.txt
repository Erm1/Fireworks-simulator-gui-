Project #3
Lab Section - MW 2:00PM to 3:15PM 
I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

1. All the code is explained in the java code. To add how the game works, when the player runs the game, 
   a packed frame with a panel added to it will show up. The user can change the data to project the firework. 
   once the user has finished inputting data, he/sh should click on the launch button. As sson as the launch 
   button is pressed, The firework will appear on the screen(the user has to expand to frame to look at the firework).
   If the user inputs a new data, the previous firework will be repainted by the new firework! this process continues
   until the user exit the game.
